Due to the bad performance of python, many things have been deleted.

I rewrite this game because I think rhythm games are not good enough without custom games.

Oxynoe's skill has been edited because it is too similar to crawler's one.

## compiling

No mobile phone support.

Install Python and Pygame. Python 3.11 may not be supported.

Run `main.py`. 

## credits

This program is a homework for University of Science and Technology of China Computer Programming & Computational Thinking Class.
